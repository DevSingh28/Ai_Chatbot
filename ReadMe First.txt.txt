Summary:

I have created an advanced AI chatbot using Python, HTML, Flask, and the OpenAI API.
This chatbot leverages the power of natural language processing to engage in intelligent and interactive conversations. 
The backend is built with Python and Flask, providing a robust and responsive server framework.
The user interface, designed with HTML, ensures a seamless and intuitive experience for interacting with the chatbot.

What sets this chatbot apart is its integration with the OpenAI API, enabling it to access cutting-edge language models.
These models enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and generate human-like responses.
By harnessing OpenAI's advanced capabilities, my chatbot offers users a sophisticated and personalized conversational experience.


Things you need:

1.import flask
2.import openai
3.API Key (Go and create a account on openai plateform and create your own api key. If you are facing an issue search on Youtube = How to get apikey from openai plateform)



How to use(if you don't know):

1.Open your IDE (ex - Pycharm or vscode).
2.Copy and paste the app.py code in your IDE (First create a new python file).
3.Create a new folder. The name of the new folder is must be templates (The templates folder or python file must be in same directory).
4.Inside templates folder paste the index.html file (Don't change the name of index.html file).
